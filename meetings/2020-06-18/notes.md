# PhD project meeting notes 2020-06-18

Attendees: Tom B, Gib, Nic, Tom G

## Agenda

* general updates
* h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> manuscript

## general updates

* Finished technical updates to EWAS Catalog, just need to update the data in there now 
* Should have an ewas-gwas pathway comparison project manuscript by the end of this month
* h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> manuscript comments should be addressed by the end of this week
* Sending intro - Please can you get it back to me in 3 weeks. This way I'll have a week to go over comments before our next monthly meeting.

## h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> manuscript

Latest version: [h2ewas_paper_TRG_njt.docx](h2ewas_paper_TRG_njt.docx)

Comments to go over:
1. Nic's on intro
2. Tom's fig 4 (related to Nic's at start of discussion) --> Is it all just lack of power?
3. Nic's in 2nd paragraph of discussion

__NOTES__
Added some comments to the manuscript

## ewas-gwas comparison project

don't use causal and consequential. Just use GWAS-specific and EWAS-specific pathways

for pathway analysis, worth using stringdb instead of other pathway databases

Interesting question: could you recapitulate GWAS genes from EWAS genes. Of course this depends on the trait...

Also important to think about how genetic architecture and epigenetic architecture of traits would relate to their "overlap".

Strikingly there is so little overlap between EWAS and GWAS. This suggests they are measuring separate things... And gives weight to the idea that DNA methylation is more similar to other observational phenotypes than genotype
