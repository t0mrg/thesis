## a method by any other name

* Don't mind how we name h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> 
	+ originally called it m<sup>2</sup>
	+ Doug asked for it to be changed to h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> with no push back at time
	+ I like the idea it has "EWAS" in the name
	+ If h<sup>2</sup> makes it seem as though we're measuring heritability of DNAm then happy to change it
	+ Nic suggested m<sub>r<sup>2</sup></sub> -- ??
