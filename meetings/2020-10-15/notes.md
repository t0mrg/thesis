Attendees: Tom B, Gib, Nic, Tom G

## Agenda

* [h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> name change](#name-change)
* [other thesis bits](#other-thesis-bits)
* [comments](#comments)
* [properties of ewas enrichment](#properties-of-ewas-enrichment)
* [AOB](#aob)

## h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> name change <a name="name-change"></a>

* Don't mind how we name h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> 
	+ originally called it m<sup>2</sup>
	+ Doug asked for it to be changed to h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub>
	+ I like the idea it has "EWAS" in the name
	+ If h<sup>2</sup> makes it seem as though we're measuring heritability of DNAm then happy to change it
	+ Nic suggested m<sub>r<sup>2</sup></sub> -- ??

## other thesis bits

* Mocks setup

* Updating results with new data?
	+ Important to think about how to frame this in thesis

* Adding in a "Data sources" chapter
	+ Think that it may not be "needed" as I can put the data in the first results chapter it's used in and then just refer back to it
	+ BUT could be useful as the use of data differs between some chapters -- may be confusing saying in the EWAS Catalog chapter "we used ALSPAC data for xyz" and then having to refer back to that

* Anything else to think about at this stage?

## comments

* Tom G: one drive

* Nic: anything you want to talk about re. your comments? 

### ewas-gwas comparison

* NJT great Q: "what would happen if you had infinite power for both the GWAS and the EWAS? One assumes that the overlap would then be a function of the genetic architecture of the trait of interest. If you had something truly poly/omnigenic, then you would get overlap I guess as you find “genetics of” confounding. For mono/oligogenic traits, overlap will always be capped. This may make you reflect more on the power/capacity of the EWAS and GWAS and how this may have shaped your learning here (e.g. educational attainment which you have)?"
	+ Definitely think it's worth discussing this, but in the intro or discussion?

* More ambitious with conclusion -- best way to talk about expansion to more than 7 traits?

### EWAS Catalog

* Comparison of EWAS Catalog to other datasets to get across why pooling data is useful

* Justifying decisions made before I came on-board? -- e.g. why include only associations at P<1e-4?

### Properties of EWAS

* will discuss these at next meeting! 

### Intro 

* Structure of intro to whole thesis
	+ GH: could re-structure intro so it is more high-level
	+ NJT: "opening lines are key to getting the reader with you - use turns of phrase that ensure they get that you are deeply aware of the properties of the data you are focused on for your work"
	+ agree with both -- struggled a lot to write this...

* Couple of things I didn't quite understand from comments, but can leave to next meeting
	+ including this from NJT: '“omewide” era where hypothese were abandoned for acephaly"'

## properties of ewas enrichment

* do CpG sites identified in EWAS tend to be enriched within certain areas of the genome?
