## Properties of EWAS work

Charlie ran analysis for each of the 6 LOLA annotation types

If we just look at "encode segmentation" then that would make things easiest I think in terms of talking about genomic regions.

[encode segmentation results](encode_segmentation_or_plots.pdf)

Of roughly 10,000 sites at p<1e-7, roughly 6000 are hypomethylated in relation to trait... If DNAm changes are tagging changes in gene expression, then this is what I'd expect given enrichment for transcribed genes + TSS

How to present these results concisely??

## Updating ewas-gwas comparison scripts

Updating scripts to make second run through easier. 

* Is there a way to search the studies data for the open gwas project like the website? Or do I need to come up with my own "fuzzy" matching code in R?

* Think opengwas project is missing data from a big smoking/alcohol gwas: [pmid=30643251](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30643251/)

* Also, the "ieu-b" IDs aren't present here: "/mnt/storage/private/mrcieu/data/IGD/data/public" - is extracting data using that directory reproducible (will it keep being updated??)

* Smoking phenotypes... 
	+ miss phenotyped former vs never
	+ current vs never EWAS == ever smoked regularly GWAS?

## Updates on everything else

- Will email Nic + Tom as still no comments on ewas-gwas comparison paper or any other chapters
- Still waiting on others for EWAS Catalog data -- emailed Paul about it as need his GEO data
- Chapter 7 has been edited into the thesis -- Going to have a quick run through then send it over to you. Will highlight things that need to be checked -- 1. acknowledgement of others work, 2. whether to move datasets into "Data sources" section.
	+ Chapter 7 is also very long because of all the supplementary figures and tables that needed to be included
- Discussion comments
