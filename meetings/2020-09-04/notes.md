Attendees: Tom B, Gib

## Agenda

* Properties of EWAS project
* Viva
* AOB

## Viva

Examiners suggested sound good to me. Will get draft abstract prepped

Start date for post-doc is Jan 4th so viva in December would be perfect if possible.

__NOTES:__


## properties of ewas project

Little bit unsure about how to present the relationship between DNA methylation-trait associations and various cpg characteristics... 

__NOTES:__

* May be issue with low variance CpGs as the technical variation to true variation ratio increases so it's more likely variation is due to technical effects rather than actual effects!

* make results section quite large by discussing stuff in the results section! - rationale, result, interpretation! 

## AOB

* Another thought on MR EvE stuff - think it's really worth emphasising what using a machine learning approach might add to using the manual approach. If I'm interested in using MR to estimate the effect a small number of exposures on a small number of outcomes (i.e. most MR studies) then why would I not use the manual approach?
