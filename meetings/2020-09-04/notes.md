## AOB

* Another thought on MR EvE stuff - think it's really worth emphasising what using a machine learning approach might add to using the manual approach. If I'm interested in using MR to estimate the effect a small number of exposures on a small number of outcomes (i.e. most MR studies) then why would I not use the manual approach?
