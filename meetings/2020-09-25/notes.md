## Agenda

* colocalisation project
* AOB

## ewas-gwas comparison paper

Giving an example of "biological insight" differences using the pathways was very subjective. Most of the pathways for which genes were enriched were very generic such as "protein binding" so had to look through all the traits to find one in which the GWAS pathways identified made sense...

__NOTES:__

Could send to people for comments on writing and tell them cba to conduct more analyses

## colocalisation project

would be up for doing the colocalisation project at some point in the future if nobody else has done/wants to do it.

__NOTES:__

Gib putting some simulations together + may end up doing by himself -- will discuss project more in a few months time! 

## AOB

* Check whether formal process means handing in project
