## Enrichment analyses for properties of EWAS project

* What I want: give you a list or multiple lists of CpGs and then you do enrichment analyses on those and give me the output


* What does LOLA output? 
	+ Does it do genomic region as well as epigenetic mark enrichment?

Lots of different things -- Chaz can output everything and we can run through what may or may not be significant

* Is there a recommended number of CpGs that should be input?

No - Chaz previously worked on analyses using roughly 100 sites

* When do you think you can do the work? 

Starting asap! 

* Are you ok to have all the scripts on git?
	+ Need this for thesis 
	+ Will start with separate repo on gitlab thatâ€™ll be private
	+ Then will move this to github when all finished

Will make a separate git repo
