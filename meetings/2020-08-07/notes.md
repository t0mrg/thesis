## ewas-gwas comp

Looking at correlation between pathway enrichment scores between GWAS of the same traits is more complex than I first thought it would be... Some correlations close to 0. At first I thought oddities could be because the number of SNPs being identified was low amongst a lot of GWAS [n_snps_histogram.pdf](n_snps_histogram.pdf). 

However, it isn't as simple as that: [snp_diff_rho_plots.pdf](snp_diff_rho_plots.pdf), [prop_snp_diff_rho_plots.pdf](prop_snp_diff_rho_plots.pdf).

Also, I accidentally stopped the architecture simulation code early so waiting for it to finish...

Really want the paper for this project to be sent off by the end of this week OR by the end of Monday. So I'm going to send it without those results in I think

__NOTES:__

Change overlap correlation plots x-axis to genes and not snps because those snps ain't clumped...

Send paper without second set of sims is fine
