## h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> manuscript

Finished going over comments. Just wanted to quickly discuss the biobank results: [biobank-plot.pdf](biobank-plot.pdf).

Also wanted to ask if I need to generate a new B number for this project or whether I can use an existing one... 

When going through this version of the manuscript please check the UKB section of the methods + supplement. It's now a very minor part of the analysis so just added a single sentence in the results to reference it and put the plot in the supplement. So I didn't put much detail in to describe the data...

There are some 'unresolved' comments in the manuscript. I've tried to answer them but realise I might not have done it justice. 

I'll send over a 'clean' (with only comments) and 'unclean' version.
