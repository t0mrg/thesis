## Properties of EWAS paper

Why is it important to know about the number of studies adjusting for batch when we already know they should be doing that? 

Got data on heterogeneity of CpG mean/sd methylation?

### Weird RA results

Found out I actually ran some analyses using GEO data. I only adjusted for SVs and they adjusted for Age, sex, smoking, cell comp. I found 27 DMPs and they found almost 50,000... 

They show changes when adjusting for batch for only 10 DMPs, but it has pretty large consequences for effect size + P value...

__NOTES:__

Worth defining set of EWAS that are suspect and removing them OR putting them to one side and repeating analyses using both those studies and others.

## Viva examiners

Other options: 

- Eilis Hannon
- John Greally

Could also have one geneticist who has done a bit of epigenetics (or at least QTL stuff)

- Ele Zeggini
- Ewan Birney
- Naomi Wray
- Tuuli Lappalainen


__NOTES:__

GH is going to contact Janine and Ele.
