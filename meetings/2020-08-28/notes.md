## Properties of EWAS paper

Why is it important to know about the number of studies adjusting for batch when we already know they should be doing that? 

Got data on heterogeneity of CpG mean/sd methylation?

[current results](paper.pdf)

### Weird RA results

Found out I actually ran some analyses using GEO data. I only adjusted for SVs and they adjusted for Age, sex, smoking, cell comp. I found 27 DMPs and they found almost 50,000... 

They show changes when adjusting for batch for only 10 DMPs, but it has pretty large consequences for effect size + P value...
