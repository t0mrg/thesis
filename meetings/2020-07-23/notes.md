## Thesis intro comments

### Overarching comments

* Many comments were specific and easy to change which is nice. I completely agree about restructuring the section discussing variance captured by all DNA methylation sites measured genome-wide -- need to explain what the problem is in DNA methylation before jumping to heritability measurements. 

* The other overarching comment was: "Got to here (end of inferring biology from signals section) and there has been a lot of discussion about a broad set of issues pertinent to EWAS and methylation – I have kid of forgotten what the job of the thesis is though – how does this all knit together?" -- This is something I really struggled with when writing the intro, knitting things together... 
	+ Here are the main questions for each results chapter [thesis-flowchart.pdf](thesis-flowchart.pdf). In the intro I have four main sections to introduce this work: 1. DNA methylation as part of the regulatory machinary, 2. Population-based studies of DNA methylation associations (includes potential value DNA methylation has as a phenotype, introduces EWAS, and discusses problems with EWAS), 3. Using methods from genetics to help inform future EWAS, 4. Overview of thesis aims -- I like this structure and think it helps knit things together
	+ The section that I really tried to tie in with results chapters is "Using methods from genetics to help inform future EWAS". Each subsection in there maps directly to a results chapter.
	+ If this general structure is ok (???) then, I guess I could solve the issue of knitting things together by just referencing back to what has been said more? I.e. point out more often the whole point of thesis is to use various methods to explore properties of EWAS and DNAm-trait relationship to help inform future study design AND qualify in each of the subsections of "Using methods from genetics to help inform future EWAS" why it's relevant?
