## Mapping variants to proteins

up to 30% of variants/cpgs identified by a trait were mapped to ensembl gene ids that do not map to proteins. 

Way that variants/cpgs are mapped to genes currently is:
Does it lie within a gene? -- if yes maps to that gene, if no maps to nearest gene

Should there be a cutoff when mapping to nearest gene? -- if not then I can just map all variants/cpgs to the nearest protein coding gene and keep it 

I guess I could do some sensitivity analysis whereby I remove variants/cpgs that are very far from the gene??

Here are distance to gene stats with ensembl gene id and hgnc symbols:
