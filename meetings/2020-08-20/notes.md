## How to present properties of EWAS

Was thinking best way to present it was: we have this database of EWAS associations, is there some underlying pattern to EWAS results that can help explain why some CpGs are associated with traits, whilst others aren't?

One reason associations can come about is because of bias - do studies tend to adjust for batch? how many DMPs may have been the result of faulty probes? Have many results been replicated? 

Could also go into cellular heterogeneity stuff (talk about that later)

If they're not due to bias then are there characteristics of CpG sites that makes them more likely to be identified? Or have an increased effect size? -- variability and effect size, average DNAm level and effect size, heritability and effect size, enrichment of sites for genomic features

__NOTES:__

Yes that works -- keep with this 


Could use the RA differences to illustrate how important it is to interogate these issues in EWAS! -- worth finding out what is likely the main reason for differences. If it's likely something everyone knows about then just point it out in the discussion of thesis, but if not then this could form some kind of letter! 

Worth also characterising the _ABCG1_ findings a bit...

## Cellular heterogeneity section

Not sure if it should be part of this project or whether it's a whole new project... [current paper](paper.pdf)

use the tissue data!! Can use r2! Higher r2 means more cellular specificity. 

Could have this talked about in the discussion and say that in ideal circumstances then 

## AOB

* Make a formal timeline that can be sent to supervisors!
