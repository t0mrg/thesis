## How to present properties of EWAS

Was thinking best way to present it was: we have this database of EWAS associations, is there some underlying patter to EWAS results that can help explain why some CpGs are associated with traits, whilst others aren't?

One reason associations can come about is because of bias - do studies tend to adjust for batch? how many DMPs may have been the result of faulty probes? Have many results been replicated? 

Could also go into cellular heterogeneity stuff (talk about that later)

If they're not due to bias then are there characteristics of CpG sites that makes them more likely to be identified? Or have an increased effect size? -- variability and effect size, average DNAm level and effect size, heritability and effect size, enrichment of sites for genomic features

## Cellular heterogeneity section

Not sure if it should be part of this project or whether it's a whole new project...
