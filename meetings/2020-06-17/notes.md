Finished. Worth sending to you first?

## ewas-gwas comparison simulations

As expected I screwed up the analysis for simulations we checked last time. Here are new results: [methods_simulations_overall_res.pdf](methods_simulations_overall_res.pdf) and [methods_test_auc_plot.pdf](methods_test_auc_plot.pdf)

see [simulations_flowchart.pdf](simulations_flowchart.pdf) for how the "pathway down" approach looks

Results from old sims here: [methods_test_pathway_down_auc_plot.pdf](methods_test_pathway_down_auc_plot.pdf). Simulations including correlation between pathway enrichment scores are on their way!

Want to be finished with this part of the project asap. I'm happy with the simulations and think the manuscript can go:

1. Region overlap
2. Simulations to check best method (and that a method could work) for gene/pathway overlap
3. gene/pathway overlap
4. gene/pathway overlap across all GWAS (+ EWAS)

Sound good? 

Also need to add in a new phenotype: blood pressure.

To-do:
1. Check the rho-p results
2. If not predictive then stick with gene overlap
3. Extract GWAS of same trait and assess gene/pathway overlap at varying p thresholds to determine p threshold going forward
4. Then assess overlap of all EWAS and all GWAS
5. Write up and send paper round
6. Think about journals to publish this in - potentials include Genome Biology, Genome Research, Nat Comms, elife
