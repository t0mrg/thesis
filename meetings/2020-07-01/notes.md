## General updates

* Currently inputting data into the EWAS Catalog
	+ Don't think this will take a huge amount of time - roughly 1 month I think
	+ As technical changes have been made, I can get going with scripts to analyse the data as soon as the manuscript for the ewas-gwas comparison paper is finished
* Started reformatting results chapters

## Run through of ewas-gwas comparison paper
