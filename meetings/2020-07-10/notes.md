## h<sup>2</sup><sub>EWAS</sub> paper phenotypes

Phenotypes are cleaned up. Had to chuck a few out because they're completely meaningless. Such as phenotypes that reflect the accuracy of some coding tool. Still have 401 phenotypes though

Need a way to make data available. Was thinking zenodo, already have an account, but main issue is uploading the data takes FOREVER as my upload speed isn't very fast. Could use bc4 and their zenodo's API to make upload speed faster? 

Have also added in supplementary table with these phenotypes and number of hits each phenotype has at the two main P val thresholds used and updated the numbers in the paper.
