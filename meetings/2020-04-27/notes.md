Attendees: Tom B, Gib

Agenda: 
* github to track meetings
* when to start the properties of ewas project
* ewas-gwas comparison simulations
* predicting the evolutionary trajectories of human traits
* AOB

## github to track meetings
How to use issues to help?

__NOTES:__
Can add stuff as a todo list if wanted

## when to start the properties of ewas project
There are a lot of papers that are waiting to be input into the ewas catalog currently... so I'm not sure if it's best to start the project now or wait for a bit.

__NOTES:__
Clean data manually in EWAS Catalog first before starting. Can put together some scripts, but would be best if the data in the ewas catalog were all there --> Chat to Matt and Paul about timing.

## ewas-gwas comparison simulations
See `sim_report.pdf`

__NOTES:__
Talking about it on Friday

## predicting the evolutionary trajectories of human traits
Do you know what's happening in terms of jobs funded by fellowship funds?
Also, what would your thoughts be on starting dates etc.?

__NOTES:__
GH is going to look at fellowship stuff again and get back to TB

## AOB

### m2 manuscript
New plan: make changes GH suggested and send to all with deadline to submit (give 3 weeks).

### EWAS Catalog
Getting upload pipeline sorted may be harder than previously thought:
IEU database --> API orchestrates uploads. Goes through several docker containers to check EVERYTHING and outputs it into a document. It doesn't get input until somebody OKs the document

Give everything possible an ontology and only allow ontologies to be input!
