# PhD project meeting notes 2020-05-21

Attendees: CANCELLED

## Project progress

### EWAS Catalog
Next week we're starting the final part of updating the catalog before sending out the manuscript (updating with newer publications). So hoping this will be done very soon. 

### Properties of EWAS
Will start analysis once data in EWAS Catalog is updated. After the last meeting I've updated the [analysis plan](properties-of-ewas-plan.pdf). If you can have another quick look through it and give any comments that'd be great. I don't really want to get moving with this project until I'm happy with the EWAS Catalog, but if we're happy with the analysis plan then as soon as that project is finished then I can immediately get started with this. 

### Comparison of EWAS and GWAS
First draft of manuscript is written. Need to work out a couple of kinks and then will send round.

## Thesis writing

Formatted DNAm-lung cancer MR into the results section.

Started on intro. Hoping to get a first draft of this to you by the end of this month or in the first week of June.
