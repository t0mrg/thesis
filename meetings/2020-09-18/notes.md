## ewas-gwas comparison paper

Once we have new data, the number of EWAS with sample size > 4500 will be roughly double what we have currently... I guess an idea would be to keep it at seven traits in the thesis and expand it for the paper?? 

- try and keep paper and thesis chapter together for as long as possible

Added in the extra simulations after the empirical results. so results sections goes:

- Overlap in genomic regions identified
- Assessment of power to detect overlap (sims 1)
- Empirical overlap
- Using empirical overlap to understand architecture of traits
- Overlap of non-corresponding EWAS and GWAS

Was thinking just a z-test to determine whether there is a difference between empirical correlation of enrichment scores and mean simulated value.

Also, I think based on our discussions I'm going to remove "consequential" from the manuscript and just use "non-causal" instead. I'll also add to the discussion that sampling genes at random to populate the "non-causal" genes is likely to be incorrect and any genes identified through confounding or reverse causation in EWAS may be correlated with the causal genes in some way.

- this sounds fine

Some meeting notes

## properties of ewas 

[Association between variance and mean meth level](variance_vs_avg_meth.png)

[mean meth level and effect size](avg_meth_vs_absolute_effect_size.png)

What was thinking behind centering on zero? - effect size vs. abs(mean_meth - 0.5) + variance + h2 

Also calculate AUC for all of them

Genomic features stuff central to chapter -- interested in probe design.
