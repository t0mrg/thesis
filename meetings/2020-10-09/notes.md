__NOTES:__

properties of ewas:
- Would be nice to touch on differences in populations:
	+ Have a look at the data and see if we can draw any conclusions from why it's important to include different populations in analyses

Don't bother sending revised intro to TG + NT. When ready just send the whole thesis and say cast eyes over it to see which parts need to comment on.

## ewas-comparisons

Started re-doing analysis adding in the latest GWAS results and no change in conclusions (so far) -- even though re-doing analysis meant adding a new trait (CRP)

__NOTES:__

Some meeting notes

## AOB

* Got some mocks set up! 

* Should be aware of what single cell could bring to the table -- could make up some sort of digested version of conclusions and ask about whether this speaks to moving towards single cell.
