## log of errors when building

### Error: Package inputenc Error: Unicode character (U+2003) (inputenc) not set up for use with LaTeX.

__Extra details__: This occured when copying text over from a paper into a chapter. Unicode character (U+2003) is just whitespace.

__Solution__: Just re-entered the text part by part and re-built the thesis each time to check it worked.
