# Introduction

This thesis focuses on epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), which assess the association between DNA methylation changes throughout the genome and traits of interest. BLAH BLAH BLAH





## Overview of thesis aims

__BELOW IS TERRIBLE BUT HELPFUL AS IT GIVES STRUCTURE__

EWAS might be an effective study technique to help provide biomarkers for better diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of disease and traits and further it could provide insight into trait aetiology as well as the downstream effects of a trait. However, with the field in it's infancy, there has yet to be a comprehensive look at what information has been gained from EWAS, what information is still to gain from EWAS in it's current state and whether or not the sites identified in EWAS are likely to be causally related to traits. 

In Chapter 3 the aim is to produce a database that brings together all the information currently published (as of X-date) together along with new EWAS with full summary statistics. This vast database will then be explored in Chapter 4, giving a detailed picture of what sites throughout the genome have been discovered in EWAS and exploring why they might have been discovered. NEED TO ADD IN HOW!

After exploring the information already gained from EWAS, Chapter 5 explores the amount of information still to gain from EWAS. NEED TO ADD IN HOW!

The database from Chapter 3 will again be used to extract large EWAS datasets for Chapter 6, where potential biological information from these EWAS will be compared to that of GWAS from the same traits. NEED TO ADD IN HOW!

Finally as an initial means of assessing whether DNA methylation might be causally associated with traits of interest, Chapter 7 will aim to use MR to help infer if DNA methylation identified in EWAS of lung cancer are likely to be causing lung cancer.
