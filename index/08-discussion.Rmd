## Overview {#overview-08}

Phenotypic change cannot occur without molecular change. Identifying these changes adds to the aetiological understanding of traits and thus has the potential to uncover novel therapeutic targets (REFs). Further, studying the association between molecular marks and complex traits may yield new, valid predictors that could augment current prediction capacity within clinical practice (REFs). 

Given the strong links made by experimental researchers between DNA methylation and the regulatory processes in cells (REFs), there was precedent for studying the covariation between DNA methylation and complex traits with the hope of discovering new facets underlying trait biology. 

Over the past 10-15 years, there have been some EWAS that have identified several reliable associations between DNA methylation and complex traits, for example with smoking (REFs) and body mass index (REFs). However, the trend has been for EWAS to identify few sites reliably associate with complex traits (REF). This was showcased in __Chapter \@ref(ewas-catalog)__. Understanding the aspects of EWAS that have led to this trend is imperative to progressing study designs and was the focus of this thesis.

In this body of work hundreds of published EWAS along with hundreds more EWAS I conducted were catalogued in an open access database. Using this data, I showed associations reported in EWAS to date are partly the result of unaccounted for technical effects, such as inclusion of poor quality probes, as well as the characteristics of DNA methylation. Further, the trait variance captured by individual DNA methylation sites was highly varied and likely inflated amongst some studies. Upon further examination of this covariation, it was found that the variance captured by all DNA methylation sites used in EWAS for 400 complex traits tended to be near zero, giving DNA methylation low total predicitive capacity across these traits. The capacity to understand aetiological aspects of traits from EWAS also appeared to be limited, although this was only tested amongst XXX traits. Upon comparison of associations between DNA methylation and lung cancer from observational EWAS and Mendelian randomization analyses, confounding was confirmed to be a problem, potentially accounting for a substantial proportion of observed EWAS associations. 

These findings suggest that substantial changes are required in the design of EWAS to aid the identification of valid predictors and enhance aetiological insight. 

## Extensions to this work {#extensions-to-work}

### Beyond the HM450 in blood {#beyond-the-hm450}

This work focuses on the measures taken for contemporary EWAS, namely use of the HM450 to measure blood-based DNA methylation. Given the correlation structure across all DNA methylation sites in the genome is not known, this work can not be generalised to DNA methylation as a whole. Further, although certain aspects of observational EWAS, such as propensity for confounding, will always hinder interpretation of results, other aspects of this thesis may not apply to data from other tissues. 

There is overwhelming evidence that complex traits are polygenic (REF) and some hypothesise that they may even be omnigenic (REFs). As DNA methylation is so tightly linked to gene expression regulation, it seems likely that either DNA methylation or something coupled to it has a substantial impact on the aetiology of many complex traits. Thus, the issues uncovered with EWAS in this thesis, such as the lack of covariation between DNA methylation and complex traits, is likely because too few sites are being measured in the wrong tissues. Finucane et al. devised a method, based on using LD-score regression and gene expression data, to identify the most relevant tissue and cell types to X diseases (REF). Without access to large datasets with DNA methylation available in a plethora of tissues, molecular epidemiologists could rely on inferences made from studies such as this to help design future EWAS. 

The impact of different methylation states of the genome, such as hydroxymethylation, is also relatively unknown (REFs). The current methods, which revolve around bisulphite conversion, capture all methylation states. If these states have differing effects, separating these out will increase power and impart greater biological understanding. 

In a similar vein to other omics, sequencing technology will likely continue to improve and will become cheap enough to use across population samples. Also, despite the vast majority of EWAS being conducted using blood (__Table \@ref(tab:study-data-tab)__), there are XXX other tissue types recorded in the EWAS Catalog. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has recorded DNA methylation data in a large number of tissues, and the trend to measure other tissues is likely to continue, especially as the number of reliable sites identified in EWAS tends to be low. In addition, manuscripts using techniques to measure gene expression and DNA methylation in single cells are becoming more common (REFs). Given the issues of cell specificity, these studies may prove pivotal in advancement of the field of epigenetic epidemiology. 

As discussed in __Chapter \@ref(properties-of-ewas)__, DNA methylation is a binary measure, yet by pooling groups of cells and measuring methylation at each site as a proportion of the DNA molecules that are methylated, a continuous measure is derived. If cells of the same type are identical then one would expect they would be methylated at the same sites as one another. However, a mosaicism of methylation across cells may exist. If this is possible, then pooling groups of cells for analysis, and taking account differences between higher order cell types, will remain a valid approach for EWAS. However, if strong evidence is provided that this cellular mosaicism is improbable between cells of the same type, rapid movement towards single-cell techniques is likely.

### New methods and data {#new-methods-and-data}

There is still substantial interest in assessing the association between DNA methylation and complex traits. In 2020 alone, there have been over XXX EWAS conducted that are suitable for adding to the EWAS Catalog. Further, new methods are being developed to measure the association between DNA methylation and complex traits. The group that developed GCTA, have also developed a command line tool to conduct EWAS using different models, OSCA (REF). There was recently a study that developed a Bayesian approach to conduct EWAS, using various confounders including genotype in their model (REF). 

This interest will hopefully lead to a continuation in developments across the field of molecular epidemiology, but the complex nature of molecular pathways to disease may make aetiological inference progression slow. Causal inference methods such as MR help provide evidence in aetiological studies, but the lack of independent instruments coupled with the complexity of gene regulation make it difficult to be confident the assumptions (__Figure \@ref(fig:mr-diagram)__) are met. Colocalization is now being readily used in the context of molecular MR, but this only provides evidence that the complex trait and the molecular phenotype have the same causal genetic variant(s) (REFs), and do not provide evidence against these variants being pleiotropic. 

Lack of large-scale studies was a problem in identifying valid instruments for individual CpG sites, including within my study in __Chapter \@ref(dnam-lung-cancer-mr)__, but this has been partially eleviated by the development of GoDMC (REF). However, like others, this resource is focused on blood-based mQTLs, and tissue-specific QTLs are lacking. Yet GoDMC has already yielded interesting results. Min et al. performed MR to establish whether there was likely an effect of DNA methylation changes, measured by the HM450, on XXX complex traits (REF). Similarly to the results presented in this thesis, they found that evidence for the aetiological relevance of DNA methylation measured across those sites was severely lacking. 

For prediction, the complexity of establishing causality and understanding cellular function need not apply. Whether the goal is to identify DNA methylation differences that co-exist with disease states and could therefore help diagnose these states, or truly predict diseases before they arrive is important to consider. For the former, large scale cross-sectional studies suffice, but for the latter cohort studies such as ALSPAC are required. Larger studies, such as Generation Scotland (REF), provide the opportunity for developing more precise predictors and further, the power gained from the extra samples would enable one to estimate the total predictive capacity of DNA methylation for individual traits with relatively high precision using the methods laid out in __Chapter \@ref(h2ewas-chapter)__.

### Beyond DNA methylation {#beyond-dnam}

As the premise of aetiological EWAS is that DNA methylation changes may impact upon some cellular function, which leads to phenotypic changes, stopping at epidemiological evidence is not enough to lead to translatable opportunities. How DNA methylation is changing these cellular functions is key for two reasons, 1. it might not be possible to target DNA methylation directly to treat/prevent disease and 2. DNA methylation may just be tagging some other epigenetic mark and in fact be inconsequential to phenotypic state. Therefore, once a link between DNA methylation and complex traits is established, it is required that experimental work is undertaken to fill in the gap of how DNA methylation changes relate to cellular function differences that influence the trait.

The burden of performing that experimental work is partially taken away from researchers by the availability of datasets such as ENCODE (REF)...  

* If DNAm not causal for many diseases, then there is little value for modifying it to prevent/treat disease is. May be worth looking to other epigenetic marks, but much work needed there!!

Recently large-scale datasets have been developed to analyse the relationship between protein expression and gene expression with complex traits (REFs). Proteins are often the ultimate target for many pharmaceuticals, as understanding of function and quantification of proteins and their variants increases, protein-based epidemiological studies may supersede EWAS with regards to their frequency. However, knowing the interconnected nature of regulatory processes, it seems likely that these studies will just augment one another, and provide opportunities to triangulate evidence from different sources (REF).   

It would be remise to not briefly mention the complexities these studies face too. In addition to those faced by DNA methylation studies, such as problems with tissue specificity and confounding, protein and gene based studies suffer from the fact that their measures can take on different states. Gene transcripts can be spliced and altered by post-transcriptional modifications and proteins can be modified post-translation of gene transcript. In extreme cases, proteins have been known to have completely different effects depending on their state. The protein P53 acts as a tumour suppressor in its natural state, but during cancer development there is evidence that the protein can be modified and become oncogenic (REFs). 

Therefore, it seems unlikely that other molecular studies will completely supersede EWAS.

## Final conclusions {#final-conclusions}

Something that should be blindingly obvious to everyone in the field of epidemiology or biomedical science is that the human body is unfathomably complex. Understanding it requires a huge concerted effort from the entire, global research community. Returning to the example of P53, there have been over XXX studies on this single protein (including studies of it's mRNA transcript and the DNA sequence that codes for it). This illustrates the patience required to elucidate the importance of cellular factors to disease. Given the brevity of existance molecular epidemiology has had, I'd argue that judging whether it has been a success or failure is a frivolous task. However, to speed up development of the field, there is a need to understand why EWAS have not yielded the aetiological or predictive capacity hoped. 

This thesis provides evidence that the study design of current EWAS is unlikely to provide substantial improvements in the ability to predict or understand the aetiological aspects of complex traits. 

Key next steps will be diversifying the tissue and cell types collected as well as the DNA methylation sites measured in the genome. Further, more experimental studies, that will inevitably come with time, will aid in epidemiological inferences.

It is important to note that this thesis, and many other molecular epidemiology studies, primarily focuses on samples of European origin.  To realise the full potential of molecular epidemiology and to help benefit all in our society, the samples collected must be expanded to those of all ethnic backgrounds. There has been a push in recent years within the genetics community to conduct studies using participants with a more diverse ethnic background (REFs). Molecular epidemiologists should use this opportunity to measure DNA methylation in the new samples generated for genetics studies.

Overall, as with many issues in research, the solutions may lie with collecting more data, but imperative to faster development is collecting the right data for analysis. With regards to EWAS, it is unlikely that measuring relatively few DNA methylation sites in blood will yield many aetiological insights, therefore diversification is key to the future of this study type.
